\section{Appendix: Sample figure}\label{app:sample-figure}

This appendix demonstrates how to include a figure with a caption, label and reference.  See \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Inserting_Images#Captioning.2C_labelling_and_referencing}.  The caption should explain what is presented in the figure.  As always, link the figure into the main body of text as follows: Figure \ref{fig:poster} shows a modern poster of Oscar Wilde's ``ÃŒmportance of Being Earnest''.
\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Poster for `The Importance of Being Earnest'}
